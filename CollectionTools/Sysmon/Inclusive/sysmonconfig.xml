  REQUIRED: Sysmon version 7.01 or higher (due to changes in registry syntax and bug-fixes)
	https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon
	Note that 6.03 and 7.01 have critical fixes for filtering, it's recommended you stay updated.

  NOTE: To collect Sysmon logs centrally for free, see https://aka.ms/WEF. Command to allow log access to the Network Service:
	wevtutil.exe sl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational /ca:O:BAG:SYD:(A;;0xf0005;;;SY)(A;;0x5;;;BA)(A;;0x1;;;S-1-5-32-573)(A;;0x1;;;NS)

  NOTE: Do not let the size and complexity of this configuration discourage you from customizing it or building your own.
	This configuration is based around known, high-signal event tracing, and thus appears complicated, but it's only very
	detailed. Significant effort over years has been invested in front-loading as much filtering as possible onto the
	client. This is to make analysis of intrusions possible by hand, and to try to surface anomalous activity as quickly
	as possible to any technician armed only with Event Viewer. Its purpose is to democratize system monitoring for all organizations.

  NOTE: Sysmon is NOT a whitelist solution or HIDS engine, it is a computer change and event logging tool with very basic exclude rules.
	Do NOT ignore everything possible. Sysmon's purpose is providing context during a threat or problem investigation. Legitimate
	processes are routinely used by threats - do not blindly exclude them. Additionally, be mindful of process-hollowing / imitation.

  NOTE: Sysmon is not hardened against an attacker with admin rights. Additionally, this configuration offers an attacker, willing
	to study it, many ways to evade some of the logging. If you are in a high-threat environment, you should consider a much broader
	log-most approach. However, in the vast majority of cases, an attacker will bumble along through multiple behavioral traps which
	this configuration monitors, especially in the first minutes.

  TECHNICAL:
  - Run sysmon.exe -? for a briefing on Sysmon configuration.
  - Other languages may require localization. Registry and Filesystem paths can change. For example, \shell\open\command\, where "open" is localized.
  - Sysmon does not support nested/multi-conditional rules. There are only blanket INCLUDE and EXCLUDE. "Exclude" rules override "Include" rules.
  - If you only specify exclude for a filtering subsection, everything in that subsection is logged by default.
  - Some Sysmon monitoring abilities are not meant for widely deployed general-purpose use due to performance impact. Depends on environment.
  - Duplicate or overlapping "Include" rules do not result in duplicate events being logged.
  - All characters enclosed by XML tags are always interpreted literally. Sysmon does not support wildcards (*), alternate characters, or RegEx.
  - In registry events, the value name is appended to the full key path with a "\" delimiter. Default key values are named "\(Default)"
  - "Image" is a technical term for a compiled binary file like an EXE or DLL. Also, it can match just the filename, or entire path.
  - "ProcessGuid" is randomly generated, assigned, and tracked by Sysmon to assist in tracing individual process launches. Cleared on service restart.
  - "LoginGuid" is randomly generated, assigned, and tracked by Sysmon to assist in tracing individual user sessions. Cleared on service restart.
  - Sysmon does not track which rule caused an event to be logged.

  FILTERING: Filter conditions available for use are: is, is not, contains, excludes, begin with, end with, less than, more than, image
  - The "image" filter is usable with any field. Same as "is" but can either match the entire string, or only the text after the last "\" in the string. Credit: @mattifestation

  PERFORMANCE: By using "end with" you can save performance by starting a string match at the end of a line, which usually triggers earlier.

			Ultimately, you must weigh CPU time checking many detailed rules, against the risk of malware exploiting the blindness created.
			Beware of Masquerading, where attackers imitate the names and paths of legitimate tools. Ideally, you'd use both file path and
			code signatures to validate, but Sysmon does not support that. Look into Windows Device Guard for whitelisting support. -->

		<!--NOTE:	You do not have to spend a lot of time worrying about performance, CPUs are fast, but it's something to consider. Every rule and condition type has a small cost.-->
